Personal discord bot, with a variety of features

# Features

- Provide information about these game servers, such as version, mods, address, etc
- Music playback in voice channels using Lavalink/Wavelink
- Miscellaneous fun commands

# Requirements
- Python 3.11+

# Note

- This is a personal project designed for a quite specific use case, so I don't know why you would want to run this yourself. Regardless, feel free to do whatever you want with this code (or parts of it)
